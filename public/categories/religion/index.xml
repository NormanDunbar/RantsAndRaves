        <description>The pope arrives in the UK today. Personally, I think he should be arrested. As the head of an organisation that is riven with child molesting staff he should be arrested. As the man in charge of covering up the atrocities (while a Cardinal) he should be arrested. As God&amp;rsquo;s disciple on Earth - he&amp;rsquo;s a fraud!
Why are the British Tax Payers, at a time when cut-backs are &amp;ldquo;required&amp;rdquo; paying for the head of the Vatican &amp;ldquo;state&amp;rdquo; to pay a &amp;ldquo;state&amp;rdquo; visit to the UK, forced to pay huge sums, running into multi-millions of pounds to provide security for this man?</description>

        <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a religious person - I think and check the evidence rather than accepting the word of a misogynistic bloke in a frock.
However when confronted by a religious zealot I find the following conversation goes down rather well! But then, I&amp;rsquo;m a right b&amp;rsquo;stard!
Me: Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Religious Person: No, don&amp;rsquo;t be stupid.
Me: But you believe in god?
RP: Yes, of course.
So what&amp;rsquo;s the difference?</description>

        <description>The recent revelations about the inhuman brutality and abuse heaped on innocent children by the so called Sisters Of Mercy and/or the Christian Brothers over 60 odd years in Ireland is an abomination.
Summary of the report
Reactions
But what is worse is the fact that before the report came out damning the Catholic Church for covering up and/or ignoring the abuse (physical, mental and sexual) a couple of things happened.</description>

        <description>I was shouting at a nun on TV the other night. The silly woman had [thankfully] survived the Italian earthquake and in retelling her story she said words along the lines of &amp;ldquo;I woke up when the quake started and the walls began to fall down. I got up and rushed outside. I only escaped because of god.&amp;rdquo;
Does the woman not realise that it was her &amp;lsquo;god&amp;rsquo; who was responsible for the damned earthquake in the first place?</description>
