## Registration is Suspended - For Now

{{< alert theme="info" dir="ltr" >}}
This blog post applied to my Wordpress blog, of which, this is a migrated copy. It no longer applies, but I've left it here for old time sake!
{{< /alert >}}

![](images/spam.jpeg "Stop the spam!")

Until further notice, subscribing to this blog, by _self-registration_, has been suspended. I can and will subscribe you on request - but see below for terms and conditions.

While, I was on holiday for a couple of weeks, over 4,000 spam users "registered" and I spent a lot of time devoted to cleaning up the mess. In addition I'm currently receiving about 100 new users per day - the vast majority are spam users.

Until further notice, user _self-registration_ has been suspended so if you wish to register with this site, please email me a request to:

- qdosmsq@
- qdosmsq.dunbar-it
- .co.uk

Obviously, you will need to string all three items above to make a valid email address - sorry, another attempt at reducing spam.

I will need _**all**_ of the following to register you:

- Your First name.
- Your Last name.
- Your desired nickname or username. (Will be displayed)
- Your email address. Will not be displayed.

Note: for the time being, **hotmail.com** email addresses will not be accepted unless you can give me a pretty spectacular reason why I should. 99.99% of the spam registrations I get come from hotmail.com - so for now, I apologise if you are a valid hotmail user, but the scum have spoiled it for you I'm afraid. :-(
