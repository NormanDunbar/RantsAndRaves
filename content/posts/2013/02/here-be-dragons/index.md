I took this photo in Scotland, along the Crinan Canal, back in March 2009. Anyone know what it is? Click the image for a full screen version. (**Warning** - it's 4000px by 3000px and 5.6 Mb file-size. The original file-size is even larger - it's almost 12Mb!)

**Update**: it's a [Southern Hawker](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&site=imghp&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1043&bih=689&q=southern+hawker&oq=southern+hawker&gs_l=img.3..0l2j0i24l3.1155.5725.0.7411.15.10.0.5.5.0.57.468.10.10.0...0.0...1ac.1.5.img.v-CNEuWaN2g "Google images - search for Southern Hawker"). Thanks Howard!
