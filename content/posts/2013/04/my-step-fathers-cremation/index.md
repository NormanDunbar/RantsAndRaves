**Antonio Enrico Martini** was cremated on 19th April 2013. He had been a chef for many years and one of his friends read this _Address to a chef_ when Enrico retired in 1987. The version below, was amended from the 1987 version. Both are based on _Address to a Pudding_ by Rabbie Burns.

## Address To A Chef

> Fair fa' your honest sonsie face,
> Great Enrico o' th' Italian Race,
> Ye cam' amang us lang years since, an' did enthrall,
> Wi' savoury dish o' string an' mince, cried Spaggi Bol!
> 
> Mony's the nicht we've supped your fare
> Chosen frae menu wi lovin' care;
> Aft times tempted tae hae some mair, o' Tagliatelli.
> The end result, ye can be share – an ower-full belly!
> 
> Aye, greed's a tempter, there's nae doot,
> When faced wi' grub that's unco' good,
> Tae get stuck in tae favoured food, like Canelloni,
> An' then consume, in reckless mood, Zabaglione!
> 
> That menu's fu' o' names exotto,
> Like Lasagne and Risotto,
> Try them a'! - That's been my motto – have nae fear,
> This chef, say I, (no voce sotto), has nae peer.
> 
> Now every king must hae his queen,
> Wha better then than Bonnie Jean!
> Her work, it seems, is nivver deen, an' man she's fleet,
> The quickest thing ye've ivver seen on jist twa feet!
> 
> Well, that wis then – his course is run,
> The time has come; it waits for none,
> Sae fare-thee-well tae San Remo's son, oor heart's wi' Jeannie,
> Rest aye in peace the only one full-proof Martini.

_As Amended 19th April 2013_

Rest in peace Enrico. Your Lasagne will always be the best.
