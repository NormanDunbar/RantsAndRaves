It's finally coming! Raspberry Pi has now officially started manufacture of the first production boards. See [~~http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/509~~](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/509 "http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/509") for details. (**Update 25/02/2023**: Sorry folks, dead link!)

Sadly, you can also see there why the tax situation in the UK (or possibly because of the EU) is preventing the charity from manufacturing these boards in the UK. (**Update 25/02/2023**: However, eventually, Sony in Wales started making the boards, and have done so ever since. Yippee!)

And, equally sadly, it may also be true that certain UK manufacturers don't seem to want the extra work either.

How sad are we in the UK?

Cheers.
