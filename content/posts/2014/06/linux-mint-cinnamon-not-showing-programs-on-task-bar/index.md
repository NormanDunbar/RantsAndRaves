For some strange reason, my Linux Mint Cinnamon desktop suddenly stopped showing the running program buttons on the task bar. I could only switch between running programs with ALT+TAB.

It's easy when you know how, but for those who don't, this is what you do:

- Right click on the blank task bar.
- Select the "Add to Panel..." option. (Or similar depending on your version of Mint.)
- Type "Window" into the search box.
- Select "Window List" from the subsequent list.
- Click "Add".
- Job done!
