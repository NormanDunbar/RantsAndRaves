On Sunday (14th March) I went to check on the bees. Hefting the hive was a tad tricky as they were all out and about flying around and generally being bees. The weather had taken a bit of a warm turn (relative to recent months that is) and they took advantage.

A closer inspection showed a good few had been "hopping" over the hedge to a crocus 'plantation' not 10 feet from the hive and were covered in shocking yellow pollen. This is a good sign.

I decided to take the mouse guard off and let them clear out the bodies of those bees that didn't make it through the winter. They do it so much better than me after all!

It looks like we may have managed to keep our bees alive through their first winter. Thankfully!

Cheers.
