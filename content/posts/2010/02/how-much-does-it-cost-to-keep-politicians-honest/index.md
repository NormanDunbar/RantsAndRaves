£6.5 million per year it would appear.

A new Parliamentary Standards Authority has been set up to monitor our beloved politicians and to keep them honest. According to Radio 4 today, this has an annual budget of £6.5 million and will employ 80 people.

Is it just me, or is it a tad strange that the people we elect to run (ruin?) the country should need so much watching to keep them honest?

Someone mentioned on the news last week, when discussing Grodon Brown's proposal for the new voting system, that we should have an option that says "none of the above" - well, I've been saying that ever since I first watched _Brewster's Millions_ many years ago.

In my opinion, voting should be mandatory - like Australia - but every ballot paper should have the final option of "none of the above" and that way we can show politicians exactly what we think. Gordon's new system doesn't let us show our disapproval - funny that eh?

I suppose, looking on the bright side, 80 people will have a new job.

Cheers.
