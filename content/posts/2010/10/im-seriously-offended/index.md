It seems that this new government is off it's bloody head. A new law has been introduced that means, in essence, that if someone tells a joke in the office, and someone else is offended by it, they can sue, even (get this) if the offended person didn't actually hear the joke in question!

WTF is the government doing for crying out loud? Have they not learned from the mistakes of the last Tory government (aka selfish b'stards) - led by the "lovely" Maggie T. - who were the ones that introduced the American style "sue everyone, I'm not to blame" culture, that it just leads to complete nonsense? It appears not.

I'm seriously offended by this new rule - who do I sue?

Cheers.
