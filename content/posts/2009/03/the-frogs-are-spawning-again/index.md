Just like last year, the mass orgy of frog sex is taking place on Alison's birthday! We have more mating frogs that you can shake a stick at in the pond right now. Most are spawning - as they do - some already have. It's interesting to see how the males lose interest in the females once sex has been had!

One problem I have this year, lots of the frogs are getting up the pump outlet pipe and into the filtration system. I've extracted about 20 pairs of frogs from the filter bed this weekend already. I don't want them going up there and spawning as they will clog up the works and, most likely, die as they cannot get out and there's nothing to eat in there either.

All I need now is some method of stopping them getting up the pipe and, much more importantly, some method of preventing those damned Koi from eating all the tadpoles. I have suggested a harpoon but I have been over-ruled by Alison on the matter as she loves her fish.

Cheers.
