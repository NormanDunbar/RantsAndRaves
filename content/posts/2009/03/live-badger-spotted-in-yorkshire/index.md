Coming home from our bee keeping course on Tuesday night (10th March 2009) Alison and I spotted a ghostly shape on the grass verge in the dark. Turns out to have been a live badger. We stopped (yes, it was safe to stop!) and it wandered away a few yards, paused and watched us watching it. We remained thus for about 10 seconds until it lost interest in us and wandered off into a field.

At least it wandered away from the road!

I've only ever seen wild badgers as corpses until now! Usually at the side of the road where so many end up. I have to say that they are pretty hard to see in the gloom. Must be something to do with their colouring and us humans being pretty blind at night as well!

Foxes are even more difficult to see at night - unfortunately, it's usually too late when you do spot them!

Cheers.
