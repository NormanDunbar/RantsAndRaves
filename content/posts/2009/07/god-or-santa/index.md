I'm not a religious person - I think and check the evidence rather than accepting the word of a misogynistic bloke in a frock.

However when confronted by a religious zealot I find the following conversation goes down rather well! But then, I'm a right b'stard!

**Me**: Do you believe in Santa Claus? 
**Religious Person**: No, don't be stupid. 
**Me**: But you believe in god? 
**RP**: Yes, of course.

So what's the difference? They are both 'invisible', both live in 'far away' places, both know if you are good or bad, both will reward you for being good or punish you for being bad ...

The other thing about RPs in general (ok, the so called Christians) is that when you point out that something in the Bible - _all characters and events in this book are fictitious, any resemblance to persons living or dead is entirely coincidental_ - they _always_ say that I shouldn't take any notice of _that_ bit.

Excuse me? Is this the word of god or not? Who decides what we pay attention to or otherwise then? If you are picking and choosing which bits of the 'rule book' to take note of and which to ignore, then surely you are making it all up as you go along and choosing your own customised version of the bible.

One god? I rather suspect not! The Hindu religion alone has 33 milion gods and godesses, Most of them reside in a cow, apart from the Good Luck godess, who didn't want to live in a cow, but then changed her mind and the only room left was in the cow dung! That's why Hindus burn cow dung for good luck. You couldn't make this stuff up! (Oh!.....)

And one last thing, why exactly do they put lightning conductors on church spires then? Have they no faith? :-D
