Walking through Leeds today, traffic doing its thing as usual. Then, in the distance, it could be heard.......... thump thump thump getting louder and louder and louder. Soon, it appeared, yet another bloody moron in a beat up old Corsa (or similar) with a dustbin exhaust - take note, that changes the engine's breathing and will stuff your engine a lot quicker than you think. Intake and exhaust are balanced for best results by professional engineers, and you are not one of those.

The noise, for it could hardly be described as music, is pumping out with maximum base applied and the volume turned up as loud as it will go (all the wat to 11 for Spinal Tap fans!).

Now, I love my music, but I listen to it, not everyone else on the bloody planet! I am smart enough to realise that not everyone has my taste in music, so I don't force everyone to listen to it. Why can't these driving morons have similar consideration for the rest of us?

There is an additional problems too, not just the noise. The volume is so high that whatever music _was_ intended to be played has no chance thanks to the total harmonic distortion of about 100% introduced by the crap quality speakers! You can usually hear them trying desperately to escape from their mountings.

The 'C' is silent - as in Rap Music. ;-)
