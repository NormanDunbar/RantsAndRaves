As mentioned previously on this blog, we have had a large number of breeding frogs in our pond.Well the tadpoles have hatched and are growing well. At least, the ones that manage to stay well hidden are. :-(

Those damned Koi are eating machines and there is wholesale slaughter going on in the pond at the moment. The volume of tadpoles is dwindling quite rapidly as those fat, greedy bastards (have I mentioned that I don't like them?) gorge themselves on anything that moves.

Why can't they eat the cats that we get in the garden I wonder?

I'd love to don my scuba gear and go spear fishing in the pond. Only kidding! You can't use scuba gear when spear fishing in the UK - so I'll have to use my snorkel instead!

At least I managed to save afew lumps of spawn and move them to the little ponds in the back garden for safety. No fish in there - just how I like it. Those little ones are doing well so far.

Cheers.
