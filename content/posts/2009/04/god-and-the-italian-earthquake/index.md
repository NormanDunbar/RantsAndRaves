I was shouting at a nun on TV the other night. The silly woman had \[thankfully\] survived the Italian earthquake and in retelling her story she said words along the lines of "I woke up when the quake started and the walls began to fall down. I got up and rushed outside. I only escaped because of god."

Does the woman not realise that it was her 'god' who was responsible for the damned earthquake in the first place? Or does that not count? Funny how 'god' is only ever mentioned for the good stuff.

Why do they put lightning conductors on church spires then?
