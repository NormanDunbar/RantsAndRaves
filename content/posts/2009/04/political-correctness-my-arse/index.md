As I came into work this morning (21st April 2009) I was listening to the man from the Driving Test 'agency' on Radio 4.

The person was asked about the proposals for adding a new section to the test where the examiner gives the trainee driver a set of instructions similar to directions obtained from a passer by,Â  and whether a trainee would be _failed_ for getting the instructions wrong.

The man from the agency replied , with a straight face, that "we do not fail people. We have people who pass and those who don't pass". The Radio 4 interviewer practically wet himself laughing.

Me? I was screaming at the radio again! What the f\*ck are we doing to this country with all this crap about political correctness and not hurting people's feelings? It is all lies I tell you, damned lies.

There _are_ failures in exams, driving tests and so on, no matter what you call it, they are _failures_ and it is a fact of life. Stop trying to kid on that people don't fail, they effing well do - I should know, I _failed_ my maths Higher (A Scottish Educational exam) where you get a grade between A and F, I got nothing, not a mention, zilch, bugger all in fact.

I _failed_ it so miserably indeed.

Am I bitter? No.

Has it affected my life since them? Not yet.

Do I care that I failed, well yes I do, but I know for a fact that I did _fail_, I didn't _not pass_!

Cheers.
