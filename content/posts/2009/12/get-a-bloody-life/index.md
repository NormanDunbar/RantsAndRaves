Check out [this link](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/8411894.stm "Tesco apologise to gingers") first.

Speaking as a ginger myself, I have no idea what that woman is complaining about. So what if a card says something funny about gingers (ok, funny is relative, some things I find funny others don't and vice versa) - it's called humour and it doesn't hurt!

I wonder if this woman was simply 'offended' because she was after a payout form Tesco for "mental distress" or some other such nonsense. I find that being offended is usually an indicator that you have nothing to say. It's what the religious fundies are all using as an excuse these days to complain about people saying or doing something that their particular imaginary friend would disapprove of.

The fact that this woman got TV News time and an interview on North Tonight on the BBC is laughable.

Cheers.
