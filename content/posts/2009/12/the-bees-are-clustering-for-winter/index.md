Well, the snows are here and the temperatures have dropped dramatically. The bees are settled in for winter. Hopefully they will make it through to next year (only eight days away!) and be ready to start hunting and gathering pollen, nectar and allÂ  the other stuff that they seem to like so much.

We only had them for a brief period at the end of 2009, we got them in late August/Early September but so far they seem to have been fine. Not too much varroa even with ApiGuard in the hive and I've just bought them a Christmas present of some Oxalic acid. When I get a decent enough day, I shall apply it and that should hopefully reduce any chance of getting a load of nasty mites in the new year when the brood comes on.

The mouse guard is on and secure, the bees can be seen in the brood box, clustered together for heat and warmth. With the temperatures below zero at the moment, they need all the heat that they can get.

I have 12Kg of baker's fondant in the garage all ready in case they haven't got enough stores to make it through. Regular hefting of the hive seems ok at present, but January is when queenie should start laying again, and the stores will take a severe hit when she does.

Here's to next year.

Cheers.
