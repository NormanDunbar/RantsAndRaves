I ranted previously about cyclists. Tonight, coming home from work, I saw the biggest moron on two wheels yet.So there we were at a junction. I was at the head of the queue on a dual carriageway. There was traffic crossing from our left and a cyclist arrived up the inside of a large van and cycled to the head of the queue and pulled in front of the van! 

The cyclist had no protective clothing or head gear at all. She, for it was a woman, was dressed in her sunday best by the look of things! She was now at the front of the queue, however, her position on the road put her slap bang in the middle of the other side of the dual carriageway and right in the path of the oncoming vehicles.

This woman was completely unaware of the carnage heading her way as she started to pull out into the road without looking in any direction what so ever! She was missed - very closely - by at least 4 cars. None of them much further away from destroying her than 6 inches. I kid you not.

Once she had managed to avoid all the oncoming traffic, she wobbled directly into the path of the van she had just queue jumped. Still not looking and still, miraculously, breathing and unhurt. As the van took avoiding action to avoid this lunatic, the driver tooted his horn. His reward for not killing the cyclist? 

She gave him the finger.

I suspect this woman is not long for the world. Some people should not be allowed to breed!

Cheers.
