MP's expense claims seem to be causing all sorts of trouble at the moment.

It's extremely funny how The Daily Mail suddenly went all quiet on the subject after it was discovered that the Tories had been just as dishonest as Labour. Funny that.

I work for a living and if I get a job in London and have to live there, I can claim a _limited_ amount of my overall expense back. This is fine.

Why is it that MPs, who are doing nothing more than a job - like the rest of us - can claim all sorts of _additional_ expenses over and above what we lowly workers can claim?

I can't get a load of scatter cushions on expenses for my flat in London, not that I would allow any scatter cushions within the four walls mind you, so why the f\*ck should MPs be allowed to? At our expense as well?

When they put themselves up for election they know what the job entails, London, and if they don't want to have the same overheads of working away from home as the rest of the population, then tough, don't apply for the bloody job then.

Is it just me that thinks these people have some sort of superiority complex over the rest of us? Being am MP is doing a job, nothing more, nothing less. They get paid for it and incur expenses like we all do. Deal with it in the same way that we have to.

It's not bloody rocket science after all. (But if it was, then you can bet that the rocket scientists wouldn't be getting tax payers to fund _their_ scatter cushion fund!)

Cheers.
