The recent revelations about the inhuman brutality and abuse heaped on innocent children by the so called _Sisters Of Mercy_ and/or the _Christian Brothers_ over 60 odd years in Ireland is an abomination.

[Summary of the report](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8059973.stm "Report summary")

But what is worse is the fact that before the report came out damning the Catholic Church for covering up and/or ignoring the abuse (physical, mental and sexual) a couple of things happened.

- The Christian Brothers successfully sued in 2004 (the report was 9 years in the making)Â  banning the report from naming names and so no-one can be prosecuted.

- The Catholic Church negotiated with the Irish Government with the end result that it is the _Irish Tax Payers_ who are paying the vast majority of the compensation for the crimes committed by the Catholic Church.

Something here doesn't make sense to me.

Even better, when the Irish citizens discovered this fact and created a row about it (as reported on the BBC news this morning - Tuesday 26th May 2009) the Church simply announced that it _would not be renegotiating the deal_.

I fail to see how or why the Catholic Church - one of the richest institutions in the world - should be allowed to commit heinous crimes over 60 odd years and then get off by having the people that the crimes were committed against, pay the compensation. Despicable.

My advice to people worldwide who wish to have children is simple:

- Don't. There are far too many people on this planet already and we do not need any more.
- If you ignore my advice above, don't forget to keep your children well away from the Catholics.

Actually, keeping your children well away from any form or religion sounds like excellent advice to me. Live in the real world and not the one favoured by these people who believe in an invisible sky fairy who rules over us all.

Cheers.
