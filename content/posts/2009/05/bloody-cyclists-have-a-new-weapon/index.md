Driving to work this morning when I hit the Kirkstall Road area where a perfectly good dual carriageway has been split into a bus (and cyclist) lane only and a lane for the rest of us. at the end of this section of the road, there is a set of traffic lights that only affect the non-bus (and cyclist) lane.

The purpose of these lights is to stop the normal people from getting to work on time, while allowing those on a bus the ability to get about 20 yards further up the road than they would normally if there were no lights there. Go figure, this is Leeds after all.

The lights are operated - in other words, they turn red - when a bus or coach passes over a sensor in the road about 300 yards back from the lights themselves. This allows the bus to trigger said sensor and travel at breakneck speed - as they do - towards the lights which will have turned red by the time it gets there.

Unfortunately, this morning, all the bloody cyclists were triggering the sensor as well. So every bloody cyclist passing over the section of road where the sensor was buried, turned the lights red. We all have to stop while no buses are coming and the cyclists are so far away from the lights that they will be green by the time they get there.

What a crock of shit!
