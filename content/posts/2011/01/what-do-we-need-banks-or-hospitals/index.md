The (Tory) government's _wonderful_ new system for the NHS starts tomorrow. GP's will take over running things where the Primary Care Trusts used to and Primary Care Trusts are to vanish. If _any_ hospital fails under the new system, there will be no tax-payer funded bale outs.

Strange that, they baled out the banks and have been shafted in return as bankers returned to their old ways - the ways that all political parties said would never happen again - and stuck two fingers up at the tax-payer and the government. But there's no such luxury for a hospital. Hmm.

Nice to know where their priorities lie then!

As I always say, _voting should be mandatory and there must be an option on every ballot paper entitled "none of the above"_. Mind you, I also have said for years _don't vote, the government will get in!_

Cheers,
Norm.
