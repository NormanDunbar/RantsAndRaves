I was out this Sunday hefting the hive. It's feeling a little lighter than I remember, so I suspect the girls are tucking in to the stores now. I heard from Peter, about a fortnight ago, that his girls have started laying already so it's looking good for Spring.

As I was hefting, one solitary bee flew out from the mouse guard and buzzed around me to have a look, then vanished back into the hive. This is good because it means that we have at least one bee that survived the winter!

I've got some honey from the Autumn crop all ready to feed them with, if they need it. Much better than sugar syrup if you ask me.

Cheers.
