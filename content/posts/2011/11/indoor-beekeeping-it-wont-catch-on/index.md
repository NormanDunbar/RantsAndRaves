Check [this link](http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2011/11/urban-beehive-lets-you-harvest.html "Indoor bee keeping?") (sorry, it's no longer available, but [this link](https://uncrate.com/philips-urban-beehive/) is the product being described - the Philips Urban Beehive.) for details. I'm saying nothing!

Except, maybe, I really can't see it taking off.

Well, ok then. How _do_ you stop the queen laying in the honey comb? There doesn't appear to be a queen excluder - so your honey will have all sorts of stuff in it! Larvae, eggs, etc. It really won't work!

Cheers.
