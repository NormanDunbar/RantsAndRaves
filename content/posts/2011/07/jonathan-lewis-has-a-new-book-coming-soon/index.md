Great news! (At least for us Oracle types anyway.)

Jonathan Lewis has a new book coming out. The working title appears to be "_A look at the internal mechanics of the important bits of Oracle for people who arenâ€™t planning to become rocket scientists but who do want to do a little more than just push buttons in OEM_" but this will probably change by November when it is due to be published, all going well.

Just in time for Christmas!

Check out the details [here.](http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/2011/06/17/author-author/ "Jonathan's new book.")

Cheers.
