It appears that the free, introductory Perl course has gone away. The links below are still pointing at the original tutorial, but [here's a free Perl course](https://www.udemy.com/course/perl-by-digiflax/) from Udemy as a replacement.

I'm not a Perl developer, I like to be able to read my code after I've written it! ;-) However, some people do like Perl and there are even people out there who would like to learn it.

I was recently contacted by a company called [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) who create tutorials and carry out training courses for various topics - why not give them a look if you need any training. Anyway, they were updating me on their new [introductory Perl tutorial](https://blog.udemy.com/learn-perl-a-tutorial-to-get-you-started/). I think it's well worth a look - if you are that way inclined!

You can check out their [web site](https://www.udemy.com/) as well, there is probably something there that might be useful to you.
