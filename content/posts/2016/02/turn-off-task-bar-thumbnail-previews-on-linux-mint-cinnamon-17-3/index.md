I hate it when I click on a task bar icon to open up a snoozing application, and a couple of seconds later, there's a preview of the application showing at the bottom of the screen. I don't need it as the icon tells me what it is, thanks! Getting rid is easy:Â 

_**Updated** 25th February 2021 after Mint 20 upgrade._

### Cinnamon 20.x

- Right-click the task bar on a blank space.
- Enable the switch to allow 'Panel Edit Mode'
- Right-click any task's icon in the Task Bar.
- Select 'Configure'.
- Click on the 'Thumbnails' tab.
- Deselect 'Show thumbnails'.
- Close the Configuration Dialogue.
- Right-click the task bar, on a blank area again, and disable 'Panel Edit Mode'.

The Cinnamon 17.3 options still get you to the same place, but unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be a way to unlock the 'Window List' option to allow it to be changed. Sigh!

You can also turn off the application grouping as well. This is on the 'General' tab in the Configuration Dialogue, disable the 'Group windows by application' option.

### Cinnamon 17.3 - 19.x

- Click the Menu button. (Mint's equivalent of the 'start' button in some other operating systems!)
- Choose 'Preferences'.
- Choose 'Applets'.
- Scroll down, or search, for 'Window List'.
- Select it, click the 'configure' button.
- Deselect 'Show thumbnails on hover'.

You would think, as I did, that the setting _might_ be found within the System Tray applet's configuration, but you will find otherwise!
