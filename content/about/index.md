This blog is simply a way for me to keep useful information, have a rant or rave at times, and so on.

{{< alert theme="warning"  >}}
Ok, this is the original *about* page from my Wordpress blog, created back in 2009. I've now converted this to Hugo, a static website generator, using Markdown, as I was running out of disc space on my host, so I had to reduce costs somehow after retirement. 
{{< /alert >}}

There's nothing all that special here, but you know, everyone else has a blog these days, why not me? The chances are, I won't have much to say (always a blessing as my wife Alison would agree!) most of the time anyway!

Let's see how it pans out then ....

By the way, unless I've changed it, the header picture you can see on this page was taken by a friend of mine - Scott Russell - in Belgium. The scene is one of utter peacefulness.

In reality, the pond you see, in the middle of a quiet woodland glade, is actually a First World War bomb crater. The scene of utter peacefulness has been created from an utter nightmare. Ironic or what?


Cheers,   
Norm.
